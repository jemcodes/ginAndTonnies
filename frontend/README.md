My gin & tonnies Full-Stack Project aims to bring delight to fellow cocktail connoisseurs, highball hobbyists, and every other liquor liker in between. Inspired by Untappd, I've created a community where drink enthusiasts can discover new beverages and share their thoughts on everything they try.

### Feature Spotlight
* I implemented functionality for users to create, read, update, and delete drink listings. Users can also create, read, update, and delete reviews on drink listings.
* This was my first solo build of a full React app. I found the integration with Redux to be particularly challenging. With less than a week of knowledge under my belt, I took on the task and I'm quite pleased with the outcome.

**Challenges I faced**

* The learning curve for interacting with the Redux store to grab state was steep for me. It was eye-opening when I finally understood how to connect those dots and select only the information I wanted to show.

* I felt more comfortable with PostgreSQL and Sequelize during this project after having used them in a previous group project. Still, it's a daunting task to make sure all the relationships are implemented correctly, knowing that the functionality of your app depends on it!

# Create React App Template

A no-frills template from which to create React applications with
[Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template @appacademy/simple --use-npm
```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
